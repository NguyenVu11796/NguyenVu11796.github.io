                    <h2>What the Managers Really Do?</h2>
                    <!-- <img src="/images/test.png" alt=""> -->
                    <p>When students graduate and first enter the workforce, the most common choice is to find an
                        entry-level
                        position. This can be a job such as an unpaid internship, an assistant, a secretary, or a junior
                        partner
                        position. Traditionally, we start with simpler jobs and work our way up. Young professionals
                        start out with
                        a plan to become senior partners, associates, or even managers of a workplace. However, these
                        promotions can
                        be few and far between, leaving many young professionals unfamiliar with management experience.
                        An important
                        step is understanding the role and responsibilities of a person in a managing position. Managers
                        are
                        organisational members who are responsible for the work performance of other organisational
                        members.
                        Managers have formal authority to use organisational resources and to make decisions. Managers
                        at different
                        levels of the organisation engage in different amounts of time on the four managerial functions
                        of planning,
                        organising, leading, and controlling.</p>
                    <p>However, as many professionals already know, managing styles can be very different depending on
                        where you
                        work. Some managing styles are strictly hierarchical. Other managing styles can be more casual
                        and relaxed,
                        where the manager may act more like a team member rather than a strict boss. Many researchers
                        have created a
                        more scientific approach in studying these different approaches to managing. In the 1960s,
                        researcher Henry
                        Mintzberg created a seminal organisational model using three categories. These categories
                        represent three
                        major functional approaches, which are designated as interpersonal, informational, and
                        decisional.</p>
                    <p>Introduced Category 1: INTERPERSONAL ROLES. Interpersonal roles require managers to direct and
                        supervise
                        employees and the organisation. The figurehead is typically a top of middle manager. This
                        manager may
                        communicate future organisational goals or ethical guidelines to employees at company meetings.
                        They also
                        attend ribbon-cutting ceremonies, host receptions, presentations and other activities associated
                        with the
                        figurehead role. A leader acts as an example for other employees to follow, gives commands and
                        directions to
                        subordinates, makes decisions, and mobilises employee support. They are also responsible for the
                        selection
                        and training of employees. Managers must be leaders at all levels of the organisation; often
                        lower-level
                        managers look to top management for this leadership example. In the role of liaison, a manager
                        must
                        coordinate the work of others in different work units, establish alliances between others, and
                        work to share
                        resources. This role is particularly critical for middle managers, who must often compete with
                        other
                        managers for important resources yet must maintain successful working relationships with them
                        for long time
                        periods.</p>
                    <p>Introduced Category 2: INFORMATIONAL ROLES. Informational roles are those in which managers
                        obtain and
                        transmit information. These roles have changed dramatically as technology has improved. The
                        monitor
                        evaluates the performance of others and takes corrective action to improve that performance.
                        Monitors also
                        watch for changes in the environment and within the company that may affect individual and
                        organisational
                        performance. Monitoring occurs at all levels of management. The role of disseminator requires
                        that managers
                        inform employees of changes that affect them and the organisation. They also communicate the
                        company’s
                        vision and purpose.</p>
                    <p>Introduced Category 3: DECISIONAL ROLES. Decisional roles require managers to plan strategy and
                        utilise
                        resources. There are four specific roles that are decisional. The entrepreneur role requires the
                        manager to
                        assign resources to develop innovative goods and services, or to expand a business. The
                        disturbance handler
                        corrects unanticipated problems facing the organisation from the internal or external
                        environment. The third
                        decisional role, that of resource allocator, involves determining which work units will get
                        which resources.
                        Top managers are likely to make large, overall budget decisions, while middle managers may make
                        more
                        specific allocations. Finally, the negotiator works with others, such as suppliers,
                        distributors, or labor
                        unions, to reach agreements regarding products and services.</p>
                    <p>Although Mintzberg’s initial research in 1960s helped categorise manager approaches, Mintzberg
                        was still
                        concerned about research involving other roles in the workplace. Minstzberg considered expanding
                        his
                        research to other roles, such as the role of disseminator, figurehead, liaison, and
                        spokesperson. Each role
                        would have different special characteristics, and a new categorisation system would have to be
                        made for each
                        role to understand it properly.</p>
                    <p>While Mintzberg’s initial research was helpful in starting the conversation, there has since been
                        criticism
                        of his methods from other researchers. Some criticisms of the work were that even though there
                        were multiple
                        categories, the role of manager is still more complex. There are still many manager roles that
                        are not as
                        traditional and are not captured in Mintzberg’s original three categories. In addition,
                        sometimes,
                        Mintzberg’s research was not always effective. The research, when applied to real-life
                        situations, did not
                        always improve the management process in real-life practice.</p>
                    <p>These two criticisms against Mintzberg’s research method raised some questions about whether or
                        not the
                        research was useful to how we understand “managers” in today’s world. However, even if the
                        criticisms
                        against Mintzberg’s work are true, it does not mean that the original research from the 1960s is
                        completely
                        useless. Those researchers did not say Mintzberg’s research is invalid. His research has two
                        positive
                        functions to the further research.</p>
                    <p>The first positive function is Mintzberg provided a useful functional approach to analyse
                        management. And
                        he used this approach to provide a clear concept of the role of manager to the researcher. When
                        researching
                        human behavior, it is important to be concise about the subject of the research. Mintzberg’s
                        research has
                        helped other researchers clearly define what a “manager” is, because in real-life situations,
                        the “manager”
                        is not always the same position title. Mintzberg’s definitions added clarity and precision to
                        future
                        research on the topic.</p>
                    <p>The second positive function is Mintzberg’s research could be regarded as a good beginning to
                        give a new
                        insight to further research on this field in the future. Scientific research is always a gradual
                        process.
                        Just because Mintzberg’s initial research had certain flaws, does not mean it is useless to
                        other
                        researchers. Researchers who are interested in studying the workplace in a systematic way have
                        older
                        research to look back on. A researcher doesn’t have to start from the very beginning— older
                        research like
                        Mintzberg’s has shown what methods work well and what methods are not as appropriate for
                        workplace dynamics.
                        As more young professionals enter the job market, this research will continue to study and
                        change the way we
                        think about the modern workplace.</p>
                    <p>Question: Which TWO positive functions about Mintzberg’s research are mentioned in the last two paragraphs?</p>
                    <p>A. offers waterproof categories of managers.</p>   
                    <p>B. provides a clear concept to define the role of a manager.</p>  
                    <p>C. help graduates to design their career.</p>    
                    <p>D. suggests ways for managers to do their job better.</p>    
                    <p>E. make a fresh way for further research.</p>
